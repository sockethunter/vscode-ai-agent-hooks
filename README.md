# 🔗 HookFlow - AI Agent Hooks

**Automated event-driven AI agent hooks for Visual Studio Code**

Transform your development workflow with intelligent automation! AI Agent Hooks allows you to create smart hooks that automatically trigger AI-powered code modifications based on file events using natural language descriptions.

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 Natural Language Hook Creation

- Describe what you want in plain language
- Example: _"Whenever I modify a Kotlin file, add KDoc comments to all functions"_
- AI automatically generates the appropriate code modifications

### 🎯 Event-Driven Automation

- **File Save**: Trigger when files are saved
- **File Change**: React to file modifications
- **File Open**: Execute when files are opened
- **File Create**: Respond to new file creation
- **File Delete**: Handle file deletion events

### 🔧 Advanced Hook Management

- **Visual Hook Manager**: Easy-to-use WebView interface with MCP configuration
- **Real-time Status**: See when hooks are running with MCP execution details
- **Live Editing**: Modify hooks and MCP settings on-the-fly
- **Pattern Matching**: Target specific file types with glob patterns
- **Stop Control**: Cancel running hooks anytime

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **HookManager**: Central hook lifecycle management
- **HookExecutor**: Event listening and hook execution
- **ProviderManager**: AI provider abstraction layer
- **WebView Provider**: Visual interface for hook management
- **FileUtils**: Cross-platform file operations

### Hook Lifecycle

1. **Registration**: Active hooks register event listeners
2. **Triggering**: File events trigger pattern matching
3. **Execution**: AI provider processes natural language
4. **Application**: Code changes applied to target files
5. **Completion**: Status updates sent to WebView

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite with **63 passing tests**:

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run compile            # Compile TypeScript
npm run lint              # Check code style
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Hook Management (CRUD operations, persistence)
- ✅ Hook Execution (triggers, patterns, cooldowns)
- ✅ AI Provider Integration (all provider types)
- ✅ WebView Communication (real-time updates)
- ✅ File Operations (cross-platform compatibility)

## 🔒 Security & Safety

### Built-in Protection

- **No Secret Logging**: API keys never appear in logs
- **Local Storage**: Hooks stored locally in VSCode settings
- **Permission Control**: Only modifies files based on explicit patterns
- **Execution Limits**: Cooldown prevents runaway executions

### Best Practices

- Start with simple, specific hooks
- Use narrow file patterns (`**/*.js` vs `**/*`)
- Test hooks on small projects first
- Regular backup of important code

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Standard Hooks (Non-MCP) Limitations

Standard hooks without MCP enabled implement simple prompt-response patterns. This results in several limitations:

Context Awareness

- Limited Scope: Hooks only analyze the single triggered file, missing broader project context
- No Project Understanding: Cannot analyze folder structures, related files, or project dependencies
- Static Processing: No dynamic exploration of codebase or adaptive reasoning based on discoveries

Missing Agent Capabilities

- No Multi-Step Planning: Cannot break down complex tasks into logical sub-steps
- No File System Exploration: Cannot list directory contents or explore project structure
- No Multi-File Reading: Cannot read multiple related files to understand context
- No Command Execution: Cannot run read-only commands (ls, find, grep, git status) to gather information
- No Configurable Tool Access: Missing whitelist system for allowing specific safe commands
- No Cross-File Analysis: Cannot read related files (tests, configs, documentation) to inform decisions
- No Iterative Refinement: Cannot analyze results and adjust approach based on intermediate outcomes

Examples of Current Limitations

Current: Simple transformation\
"Add JSDoc to this function" → Modifies single file

Missing: Complex agent workflow\
 "Refactor this component following project patterns" →
  1. List project files to understand structure (ls, find)
  2. Read similar components for pattern analysis
  3. Execute git status to check for uncommitted changes
  4. Extract common patterns from multiple files
  5. Apply consistent architecture with context awareness
  6. Update related tests and documentation files

Impact on Use Cases

- Architecture Decisions: Cannot analyze project patterns for consistent refactoring
- Smart Test Generation: Cannot understand existing test patterns and file relationships
- Documentation Sync: Cannot cross-reference multiple files for comprehensive docs
- Code Migration: Cannot analyze dependencies and impact across multiple files

## 🔧 Potential Solution: MCP Integration

The limitations above could be addressed through **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integration, which would enable sophisticated AI agent workflows:

### Proposed MCP Architecture

```
Hook Trigger → MCP Client → AI Model with Tools → Multi-Step Execution → File Modifications
```

### MCP-Enabled Capabilities

**File System Tools**
- `mcp_filesystem`: List directories, explore project structure
- `mcp_search`: Advanced file searching with grep, ripgrep
- `mcp_git`: Git operations (status, log, diff) for context

**Multi-File Operations**
- Read multiple related files simultaneously
- Cross-reference imports, exports, and dependencies
- Analyze test patterns across the codebase

**Configurable Tool Access**
- Whitelist system for allowed MCP tools
- Security boundaries for safe command execution
- User-controlled permission levels per hook

**Agent Workflow Example**
```
"Refactor component following project patterns" →
1. mcp_filesystem.list() - Explore project structure
2. mcp_search.find() - Locate similar components
3. mcp_filesystem.read_multiple() - Analyze patterns
4. mcp_git.status() - Check for conflicts
5. Multi-step reasoning and planning
6. Coordinated file modifications
```

### Implementation Benefits

- **Context-Aware**: Full project understanding before modifications
- **Safe Execution**: MCP security model prevents dangerous operations
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom tools
- **Configurable**: User controls which tools each hook can access

**✅ IMPLEMENTED:** The above MCP integration is now available! Enable MCP in the Hook Manager UI to unlock advanced reasoning capabilities.

### Current Status: MCP Available

The Hook Manager now includes:
- ✅ **Visual MCP Configuration** in the UI
- ✅ **Project-Specific Tool Detection** (Git tools for Git repos, etc.)
- ✅ **Multi-Step Execution** with context awareness
- ✅ **Tool Whitelisting** per hook
- ✅ **Real-Time Status** showing MCP vs Standard execution

Simply check "Enable MCP" when creating hooks to access sophisticated AI agent workflows!
